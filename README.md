# edge_detection_project

## Approach and Model Selection
For this project, I implemented both traditional computer vision methods and a deep learning approach for edge detection.

I started with the classic algorithms that are widely used in the field:

1. *Canny Edge Detector: 
This is a multi-stage algorithm that works based on the detection of intensity gradients, thinning edges using non-maximum suppression, and dual thresholding for removing noise.

2. *Sobel Filter:
This simpler process calculates both y and x direction gradients in a way to identify where pixel values are changing radically.

Deep Learning Approach
For the neural network approach, I chose a U-Net approach: 

- The model has a simple encoder-decoder structure that's good at preserving spatial information
- I used PyTorch to implement the network architecture
- In this implementation, I'm using a pre-trained model to demonstrate the concept

Results and Analysis

My experiments with the BSDS500 dataset showed some interesting differences between the methods:

The traditional methods were surprisingly effective - Canny especially produced clean, well-defined edges on most images. Sobel was faster but produced thicker, less precise edges.

The deep learning model showed promise by detecting more meaningful edges based on image content rather than just pixel intensity changes. This is the key advantage of using neural networks for this task.

Comparison Between Methods

When comparing the outputs side by side:
- Canny edges are precise and slim with strong noise suppression
- Sobel edges have stronger gradients but with lesser detail
The pre-trained U-Net detects edges with greater semantic meaning

- The traditional methods work much faster and don't utilize any training data, but lack the contextual sensitivity that neural networks can provide.

Future Work:

If I were to continue this project, I would:
 - Try implementing HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) which was designed specifically for edge detection
- Add better evaluation metrics to quantify the differences between methods
- Experiment with different post-processing techniques to improve all methods
